    title: "What is the CONSAMS?",
    content:
      "CONSAMS is a consortium of relatively “new” African medical schools. We define these new schools as those that are within about 10- 15 years of graduating their first cohort of medical students at the time of joining CONSAMS. Once a medical school has joined CONSAMS it can remain in the consortium for as long as it likes as it may provide mentorship and feedback to the newer schools.",

      "Why did CONSAMS expand from a consortium of only southern African medical schools to Sub-Sahara African medical schools?",
    content:
      "CONSAMS was founded by just 5 new medical schools in southern Africa. It soon became apparent that many new medical schools were being developed across the African continent with over 100 schools estimated to open over the ensuing decade (by conservative estimates). We realized we had much to learn from medical schools in other regions of the continent, and we were being approached by other sub-Saharan schools to join CONSAMS. The decision was therefore taken by a 2/3 majority vote of the CONSAMS Steering Committee to expand the consortium to include new medical schools in other sub Sahara African regions and to change the name to Consortium Of New Sub-Sahara African Medical Schools while retaining the acronym of CONSAMS.",
