# CONSAMS - Consortium of New Sub-Sahara African Medical Schools

CONSAMS - The “Consortium of New Sub-Sahara African Medical Schools” - was founded in 2011 under the original name of the “Consortium of New Southern African Medical Schools.” At an ensuing Annual General Meeting, it was decided to expand the organization to include members across the African continent and beyond southern - hence the
 name change from “Southern African” to Sub-Sahara African.
